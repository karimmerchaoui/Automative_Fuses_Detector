# Overview
Automotive Fuse Detector is a mobile application that helps users quickly identify and classify car fuses using the phone’s camera,
<strong>solving the problem </strong> of manual identification and reducing potential errors in the process. 

This can potentially automate control over fuse identification in automotive systems, making it a valuable tool for mechanics, DIY enthusiasts, and automotive engineers who need efficient fuse detection.


# Who Would Benefit from This Tool
-**Automotive Technicians:** Quickly identify and verify fuses during vehicle maintenance or troubleshooting.

-**DIY Car Enthusiasts:** Simplify the process of identifying fuses when working on personal vehicles.

-**Automotive Engineers:** Utilize automated fuse detection as part of quality assurance or testing processes.

-**Fleet Managers:** Ensure vehicles in a fleet have properly functioning fuses by regularly scanning fuse panels.

-**Educational Institutions:** Teach students about automotive electronics with a hands-on tool for recognizing and understanding fuse types.


# Technologies Used
- **Kotlin:** Primary programming language for Android app development.
- **Java:** Secondary language used within the app.
- **TensorFlow Lite:** Lightweight machine learning framework for mobile and embedded devices.
- **YOLO (You Only Look Once):** Object detection algorithm used for training the model.
- **Android Studio:** Integrated development environment (IDE) used for building the application.


# Features
**Real-Time Detection:** Instantly detects and identifies various car fuses using the phone’s camera.

**Accurate Classification:** Classifies different fuse types based on a TensorFlow Lite model trained with YOLO, providing precise results.

**User-Friendly Interface:** Simple, easy-to-navigate UI for quick and efficient use.

**Mobile Optimization:** Lightweight and optimized for Android devices, ensuring smooth performance.
